**Publisher:** Origo
**App:** Bifrost Hnitbjorg (`672df32a-a0c5-4a22-b591-0efa38023e95`)
**Version:** 28.0.0.0
**Submission Date:** 2026-09-05
**Test Environment:** Requires a configured Azure Blob Storage account or SharePoint document library accessible from the BC sandbox. See "Test Credentials" section below.

---

## Test Credentials

This extension connects to external cloud storage via the standard Business Central
External File Storage connectors (Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Share, SharePoint).

**Option:** Provide a test Azure Blob Storage account with a container pre-created.
Include the storage account name, container name, and a SAS token or access key
valid for at least 4 weeks from submission date.

The extension itself does not store secrets — it delegates to the BC connector apps
(e.g., "Azure Blob Storage Connector" from Microsoft). The validator must install the
appropriate connector app and configure it before testing.

## Scenario 1: Extension Installation and Setup

**Area:** Installation & Activation

### Setup
1. Start with a clean BC sandbox (Cronus company)
2. Install the "Bifrost Foundation" extension (dependency)
3. Install the "Bifrost Hnitbjorg" extension

### Steps
1. Search for "Bifrost Storage Setup" in the BC search bar
2. Verify the list page opens without error
3. Choose "New" to create a new storage connection
4. Enter "TEST" in the "Code" field
5. Enter "Test Storage Connection" in the "Description" field
6. Set the "Connector" field to the installed connector (e.g., "Azure Blob Storage")
7. Choose the "Select File Account" action and pick the configured file account
8. Set "Enabled" to true
9. Choose "Test Connection" and confirm the success message
10. Close the card page

### Expected Results
- The "Bifrost Storage Setup" page opens and is editable
- A new storage connection record is saved with Code = "TEST"
- The connection appears in the list page
- "Test Connection" reports that the connection is reachable

### Notes
- The "Connector" dropdown shows only connectors from installed BC connector apps
- The "Select File Account" lookup shows accounts registered by the selected connector
- "Base Path" may be left blank to address the account root
