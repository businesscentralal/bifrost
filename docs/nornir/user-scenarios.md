## Test Credentials

This extension uses the Telegram Bot API for notification delivery.

**Provide:** A Telegram Bot Token (from @BotFather) and a Telegram Chat ID for a test user.
The Bot Token is stored in the "Job Queue Orchestrator Setup" page via Isolated Storage (encrypted at rest).
The Chat ID is stored per user in "Bifrost User Setup" (Bifrost Foundation).

For email notification scenarios, a BC email account must be configured.
